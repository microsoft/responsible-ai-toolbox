This project contains packages to help the core responsible AI products.

This includes a shared service layer, that also maintains utilities to determine the environment it is running in and configure the local flask service appropriately.

Also, a base typescript library with controls that should be made common across responsible AI dashboards is maintained. 
Building on that, the typescript dashboards for each responsible AI product live in this project and are published to NPM for downstream consumption.
