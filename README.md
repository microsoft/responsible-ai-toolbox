# Responsible AI Widgets

This project provides responsible AI user interfaces for
[Fairlearn](https://fairlearn.github.io) and
[interpret-community](https://interpret.ml), as well as foundational building
blocks that they rely on.

These include

- a shared service layer which also maintains utilities to
  determine the environment that it is running in so that it can configure the
  local flask service accordingly.
- a base typescript library with common controls used across responsible AI
  dashboards
