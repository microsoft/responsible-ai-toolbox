      tiles for easier navigation.
    - Added fairness metric selection using a grouped list.
    - Added dropdowns to model comparison view and single model view to allow
      users to quickly switch between sensitive features, performance metrics,
      and fairness metrics.
    - Added metric table to single model view.
    - Added dropdown to switch between charts in single model view.
    - Simplified API to extract sensitive feature names directly from
